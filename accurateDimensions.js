To obtain more accurate screen dimensions, consider using the `Dimensions.get('screen')` method.  This returns the dimensions of the entire physical screen, including areas obscured by system UI. Note that this might require adjustments to your layout to account for the system UI areas.

```javascript
// Correct usage for more accurate dimensions
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('screen');
console.log('Screen width:', width);
console.log('Screen height:', height);

//For handling the status bar height you can use the following:
import { StatusBar } from 'react-native';
const statusBarHeight = StatusBar.currentHeight;
console.log('StatusBar height:', statusBarHeight);
```

Alternatively, you might need to dynamically adjust your layout based on the safe area which is provided by the SafeAreaView component.

```javascript
import {SafeAreaView, StyleSheet, Dimensions} from 'react-native';
const {width, height} = Dimensions.get('screen');
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: 'white'
  }
});

<SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
    {/*Your content here*/}
</SafeAreaView>
```
