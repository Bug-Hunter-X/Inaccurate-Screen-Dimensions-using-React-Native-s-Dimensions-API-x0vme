This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` method returns an object with `width` and `height` properties that represent the dimensions of the application window, *not* the physical screen dimensions. This can be misleading, especially on devices with non-standard notches, home bars, or software navigation buttons. These can partially or entirely obscure content of the application window, making dimensions reported by `Dimensions.get('window')` smaller than the actual screen.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage leading to inaccurate dimensions
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
console.log('Window width:', width);
console.log('Window height:', height);
```
